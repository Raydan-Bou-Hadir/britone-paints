              <p className='container-text'>
                Founded in 2001, National Paint Industries (NPI) brings over 25
                years of expertise in the production and distribution of paints
                across West Africa. NPI Liberia, the third factory in the
                region, was established in response to strong customer demand
                for Britone Paintâ€”a trusted brand renowned for its lasting
                quality and performance.
              </p>
              <p className='container-text'>
                Our growth has been fueled by the superior quality of our
                products and an unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction.
                Before NPI's establishment in Liberia, Britone Paint had been
                imported into the country for many years. The decision to open a
                local factory was driven by the brand's loyal customer base and
                their encouragement to make Britone more accessible.
              </p>
              <p className='container-text'>
                Britone's high-performance formulations have made it a market
                leader in several African countries. Today, we uphold the same
                high standards by sourcing premium raw materials from leading
                European suppliers. Our continued success reflects our
                dedication to quality, innovation, and meeting the evolving
                needs of our customers.
